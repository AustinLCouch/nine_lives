## Problem
The generated puzzle numbers (givens) looked too similar to player-entered numbers, making it difficult to distinguish between permanent puzzle pieces and user input.

## Solution
Implemented comprehensive visual distinction between given cells and player cells:

### ðŸŽ¨ **Text Color Distinction:**
- **Given Numbers**: Pure black (`Color::srgb(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`) - bold, permanent appearance
- **Player Numbers**: Bright blue (`Color::srgb(0.1, 0.3, 0.8)`) - clearly different, indicates user input

### ðŸŽ¯ **Background Color Distinction:**
- **Given Cells**: 30% darker background than normal cells (using linear color space for proper darkening)
- **Player Cells**: Normal alternating sudoku box colors (light/dark gray pattern)

### ðŸ”— **Interactive Feedback:**
- **Given Cells**: 
  - Cannot be clicked or modified (protected from user input)
  - Darker borders (`Color::srgb(0.3, 0.3, 0.3)`)
  - No interactive hover effect - shows as unclickable
  
- **Player Cells**:
  - Clickable and modifiable
  - Bright blue hover effect (`Color::srgb(0.2, 0.6, 1.0)`)
  - Normal borders that respond to interaction

## Result
Players can now instantly distinguish between:
1. **Permanent puzzle numbers** (dark text, darker background, non-interactive)
2. **Their own entries** (blue text, normal background, interactive with hover effects)

This creates a professional Sudoku experience where the puzzle structure is visually clear and user input is obviously differentiated.

## Files Modified
- `nine_lives_ui/src/lib.rs`: Updated visual styling systems
- `nine_lives_core/src/lib.rs`: Added cell type tracking and protection logic

## Testing
- All 24 unit tests pass
- Game runs smoothly with clear visual feedback
- Hover effects properly indicate interactive vs non-interactive cells
